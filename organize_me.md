Investigating IOCs:
What are some good sites for URL/IP/File Lookup?
virustotal.com  -  This site is probably the gold standard, you can upload any URL,  File, or Hash and it'll let you run it against a variety of virus  scanners to determine if the site is malicious.
hybrid-analysis.com  -  This site is an alternative that you can upload your files to scan,   it'll do more than just match hashes, but will actually actively decompile the program and scan it for malicious indicators
IPVoid.com  -  This site provides a variety of tools to lookup IP addresses to   determine if they are on known blacklists, whois/geolocation data and more.
abuseipdb.com/  -  This will check the reputation of various IP addresses and uses   crowdsourced information to see what other people have reported from this IP address.
brightcloud.com/tools/url-ip-lookup.php  -  This will let you investigate an IP, see common threats associated  with that IP address, and give possible hostnames associated with the IP
hackertarget.com/reverse-dns-lookup/  -  This site will let you do a reverse IP lookup and see if the domain  is associated with any websites or historically any websites.
urlscan.io/  -  This website will allow you to scan a URL to see what sort of connections it's making so if you've got a URL that may not be great, you could see what other sites it contacts (Malicious advertisements, drive by downloads, etc)
url2png.com - This will let you take a screenshot of a website.
https://zeltser.com/lookup-malicious-websites/ - List of additional sites to try out.

Some of the courses are free and some are not. These 3 are completely free and will cover some of the same commands and a few we won't talk about and are a great way to Augment your Linux Skills.
Linux Survival - Another site that will give you practice using some of the commands, with explanations and other methods.
